#Note :::
#
#  Yes, it is possible to change the username and password of a database when setting up environment variables in a Docker Compose file.
#  However, keep the following points in mind:
#
#  1. Ensure that no active connections are established with the database before making changes. If a connection is open,
#  disconnect it—this can be done by closing any connected applications, such as PGAdmin for PostgreSQL.
#
#
#  2. Once the connection is closed, rebuild the Docker Compose setup. This allows the new credentials (username and password)
#  to take effect and stay in sync with your application
